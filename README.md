# CoupleGenerator
Generate your lover with your photo
This project is an old project from two years ago. 
We collect pictures of marriage couples on the Internet, and pre-process the images.
The model was trained by using the code of pix2pix.

An example of training images:

The model can fit the training images in a short time. 

You can make photos of yourself with the person you loved as a training pair~

This repo is just for entertaments.
If you have any interests, please feel free to use the code and the dataset.
